CHAPTER LIII

How by the counsel of La Beale Isoud Sir Tristram rode
armed, and how he met with Sir Palomides.


SO on a day La Beale Isoud said unto Sir Tristram:  I
marvel me much, said she, that ye remember not yourself,
how ye be here in a strange country, and here be many
perilous knights; and well ye wot that King Mark is full
of treason; and that ye will ride thus to chase and to hunt
unarmed ye might be destroyed.  My fair lady and my
love, I cry you mercy, I will no more do so.  So then Sir
Tristram rode daily a-hunting armed, and his men bearing
his shield and his spear.  So on a day a little afore the
month of May, Sir Tristram chased an hart passing
eagerly, and so the hart passed by a fair well.  And then
Sir Tristram alighted and put off his helm to drink of that
bubbly water.  Right so he heard and saw the Questing
Beast come to the well.  When Sir Tristram saw that
beast he put on his helm, for he deemed he should hear of
Sir Palomides, for that beast was his quest.  Right so Sir
Tristram saw where came a knight armed, upon a noble
courser, and he saluted him, and they spake of many
things; and this knight's name was Breuse Saunce Pit
