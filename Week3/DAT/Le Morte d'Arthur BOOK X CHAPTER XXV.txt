CHAPTER XXV

How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred met with a knight
fleeing, and how they both were overthrown, and of Sir
Dinadan.


NOW leave we of Sir Lamorak, and speak of Sir Gawaine's
brethren, and specially of Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred.
As they rode on their adventures they met with a knight
fleeing, sore wounded; and they asked him what tidings.
Fair knights, said he, here cometh a knight after me that
will slay me.  With that came Sir Dinadan riding to them
by adventure, but he would promise them no help.  But
Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred promised him to rescue
him.  Therewithal came that knight straight unto them,
and anon he proffered to joust.  That saw Sir Mordred
and rode to him, but he struck Mordred over his horse's
tail.  That saw Sir Agravaine, and straight he rode toward
that knight, and right so as he served Mordred so he
served Agravaine, and said to them:  Sirs, wit ye well both
that I am Breuse Saunce Pit
