CHAPTER VI

How Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram to the court, and
of the great joy that the king and other made for the
coming of Sir Tristram.


RETURN again, said Sir Launcelot, for your quest is done,
for I have met with Sir Tristram: lo, here is his own
person!  Then was Sir Gawaine glad, and said to Sir
Tristram:  Ye are welcome, for now have ye eased me
greatly of my labour.  For what cause, said Sir Gawaine,
came ye into this court?  Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, I
came into this country because of Sir Palomides; for he
and I had assigned at this day to have done battle together
at the peron, and I marvel I hear not of him.  And thus
by adventure my lord, Sir Launcelot, and I met together.
With this came King Arthur, and when he wist that there
was Sir Tristram, then he ran unto him and took him by
the hand and said:  Sir Tristram, ye are as welcome as any
knight that ever came to this court.  And when the king
had heard how Sir Launcelot and he had foughten, and
either had wounded other wonderly sore, then the king
made great dole.  Then Sir Tristram told the king how
he came thither for to have had ado with Sir Palomides.
And then he told the king how he had rescued him from
the nine knights and Breuse Saunce Pit
