CHAPTER LXXXVII

How there was a day set between Sir Tristram and Sir
Palomides for to fight, and how Sir Tristram was hurt.


THEN said Sir Tristram:  I will fight with you to the
uttermost.  I grant, said Palomides, for in a better
quarrel keep I never to fight, for an I die of your hands,
of a better knight's hands may I not be slain.  And sithen
I understand that I shall never rejoice La Beale Isoud, I
have as good will to die as to live.  Then set ye a day,
said Sir Tristram, that we shall do battle.  This day
fifteen days, said Palomides, will I meet with you hereby,
in the meadow under Joyous Gard.  Fie for shame, said
Sir Tristram, will ye set so long day? let us fight
to-morn.  Not so, said Palomides, for I am meagre, and
have been long sick for the love of La Beale Isoud, and
therefore I will repose me till I have my strength again.
So then Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides promised faith
fully to meet at the well that day fifteen days.  I am
remembered, said Sir Tristram to Palomides, that ye
brake me once a promise when that I rescued you from
Breuse Saunce Pit
